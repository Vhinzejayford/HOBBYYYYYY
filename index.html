            <h1>Nice to meet you!!!</h1>
            <h2>  Hey! I'm a 17-year-old guy hailing from the bustling city of Caloocan. 
            Being an only child has its ups and downs, but one thing's for sure  it gives me plenty of time
            to dive headfirst into my two favorite worlds: video games and anime. Yep, you guessed it  when I'm
            not occupied with school stuff, you'll most likely find me engrossed in epic gaming quests or binging on
            the latest anime series.
            Speaking of school, I'm currently a student at the Systems Technology Institute, where I'm all 
            about delving into the fascinating realm of coding. There's just something about crafting lines of code that
            sparks my curiosity and keeps me motivated to learn more each day. And you know what's even cooler? I'm stoked
            to connect with fellow students who share my passion for tech, games, and anime. Who knows, maybe I'll even 
            stumble upon a gaming buddy or two along the way!    
            So yeah, that's a bit about me a video game and anime enthusiast with a thirst for coding knowledge
            and a desire to forge connections with awesome people who have similar interests. Let's see where
            this exciting journey takes me!
